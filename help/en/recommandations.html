<h1>Last advice</h1>
<p>This new version of the Newbb forum is thus impressive by the number of the functionalities which it has, but all that has a price. Activate for example the debug mode in mysql/blocs version and observe the number of requests generated on the main page of a forum. 
</p>
<p>If your site is higly visited and the power of your hosting is not adapted, the activation of all these innovations is likely to slow down the rendering of pages of the forum when many visitors are present simultaneously on your site. 
This is why it will be necessary for you to be attentive with determining well what seems essential to you compared to the comfort options  to obtain the best compromise.</p>
<h4>Navigators</h4>
<p>The various tests showed a better performance with Firefox than Internet Explorer. </p>
<h4>Pictures</h4>
<p> If you don't use the png hack and a picture set in a gif format increase the module rendering. (the french picture set contain gif and png pictures) </p>
<h4>Quick answer button</h4>
<p>If it can be practical this button is a source of deceleration.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>If you want to do a fresh install or an update of your forum module please backup all your files and database.
 Test your update on a clone of your site. Indeed if a module installation is a usually simple operation, there are many dependences beetwen xoops and newbb2 and so it's necessary to be careful with your real web site. </p>
